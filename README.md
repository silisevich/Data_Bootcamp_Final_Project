PROJECT DESCRIPTION
	
  This project is based on and closely follows the June 2017 World Bank Policy Research Working Paper entitled "Should Emerging Markets Worry about U.S. Monetary Policy Announcements?" by Poonam Gupta, Oliver Masseti, and David Rosenblatt. 
	
  FOMC policy announcements can have an immediate and significant impact on emerging market financial conditions. This project, like the report it is based on, analyzes that impact through same-day changes in equity prices, bond yields, and exchange rates in emerging markets. Where the World Bank report analyzes 20 countries, this report focuses on responses in three of the four largest emerging market economies: China, India, and Russia. 
	As it pursues that goal, the project can be broken into three sections. 
  
  Section 1 tracks changes in U.S. Treasury Yields on FOMC policy days under the hypothesis that greater intra-day changes signify greater surprise among market participants. 
  
  Section 2 imports, cleans, and analyzes data for changes in major equity index prices, domestic currency/USD exchange rates, and 10-year bond yields in China, India, and Russia. 
  
  Section 3 summarizes those changes in a few graphs that show individual asset price reactions and return to the idea presented in Section 1 that large U.S. Treasury yield changes correlate to more surprise, and therefore more volatility in emerging markets.
